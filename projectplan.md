  - Call 1: Business problem check (~7s)
  - Call 2: Target users check (~7s)
  - Call 3: Expected benefits check (~7s)
- **Solution Designed**: Use static question sequence Q2-Q10 to eliminate topic checking
  - Q2: Business Problem
  - Q3: AI Solution
  - Q4: Target Users & Impact
  - Q5: Data Sources
  - Q6: Technical Feasibility
  - Q7: Timeline & Investment
  - Q8: Risks
  - Q9: Mitigation
  - Q10: Build/Buy/Partner
  - **Expected Performance Gain**: 60-70% faster (eliminates 17-28s overhead)

### Criteria Validation Configuration (Completed)
- **Created**: `/Users/johndixon/Wells_Fargo_Projects/AI_Intake/src/config/questionCriteria.ts`

  - Example responses provided for guidance
  - Max 2 follow-ups per question to balance quality and UX
  - "I don't know" escape hatch for AI-assisted answers
  - QUESTION_ORDER array enforces static sequence
  - getCriteriaForQuestion() helper function for integration

### CSV Output Analysis (Completed)
