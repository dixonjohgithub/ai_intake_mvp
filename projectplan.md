# AI-Powered GenAI Idea Assistant - Project Plan

## Project Overview
Building an interactive web-based tool to revolutionize Wells Fargo's GenAI idea intake process through intelligent guidance, automated duplicate detection, and comprehensive idea assessment capabilities.

## Current State Assessment

### ✅ Completed (Task 0.0 - 0.12)
- Docker environment configuration (Dockerfile, docker-compose.yml)
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimized images
- Nginx reverse proxy configuration
- Environment variables setup (.env.example, .env created)
- OpenAI API client integration (GPT-5 reasoning engine)
- PostgreSQL container running successfully ✅
- Health check services implemented
- Basic Next.js project structure
- README with run instructions
- OpenAI API key validated and configured ✅
- Test scripts created for verification

### 🚧 Current Infrastructure
- **Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript (initialized)
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes (basic setup)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL configured in Docker
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI client configured
- **Containerization**: Full Docker setup ready

## Immediate Next Steps

### 1. Test Current Setup (Task 0.11 & 0.12) - TODAY
- Run `docker-compose up` and verify all services start
- Test OpenAI API connection with test prompt
- Verify health endpoints are responding

### 2. Wells Fargo UI Foundation (Task 1.0) - Priority 1
- Implement Wells Fargo branding (colors: #D71E2B, #FFCD41)
- Create landing page with hero banner
- Build four service tiles component
- Set up routing for AI intake workflow

### 3. Conversational Flow (Task 2.0) - Priority 2
- Build chat-like conversational UI
- Implement dynamic question generation
- Integrate OpenAI for contextual questions
- Create wizard with progress indicators

## Task Priority Order

1. **Foundation & Testing** (Today)
   - Test Docker setup
   - Verify OpenAI integration
   - Ensure all services are healthy

2. **UI/UX Implementation** (Days 1-3)
   - Wells Fargo branded interface
   - Service tiles and navigation
   - Basic responsive layout

3. **Core Functionality** (Days 4-8)
   - Conversational flow system
   - Question generation logic
   - Session state management

4. **Advanced Features** (Days 9-12)
   - Duplicate detection
   - Form generation
   - Data storage

5. **Polish & Testing** (Days 13-15)
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Decision logging
   - E2E testing

## Key Dependencies

### External Services
- ✅ OpenAI API (GPT-5) - Configured
- ✅ PostgreSQL Database - Containerized
- ⏳ Wells Fargo Design Assets - Using provided images

### Critical Path Items
1. OpenAI API working correctly (blocks all AI features)
2. Database connectivity (blocks data persistence)
3. UI framework setup (blocks all frontend work)

## Success Criteria

### MVP Requirements
- [ ] Branded Wells Fargo interface matching design specs
- [ ] Working conversational flow with AI-powered questions
- [ ] Duplicate detection with 90% accuracy
- [ ] Form generation matching intake template
- [ ] Data persistence (CSV or PostgreSQL)
- [ ] Basic analytics dashboard

### Performance Targets
- Page load: < 3 seconds
- Question generation: < 2 seconds
- Duplicate detection: < 5 seconds
- Form generation: < 3 seconds

## Risk Mitigation

### Identified Risks
1. **OpenAI API Rate Limits**
   - Mitigation: Implement caching and rate limiting

2. **Data Storage Scalability**
   - Mitigation: Start with CSV, PostgreSQL ready

3. **Complex UI Requirements**
   - Mitigation: Incremental implementation, MVP first
