# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# AI-Powered GenAI Idea Assistant

## 1. Introduction/Overview

The AI-Powered GenAI Idea Assistant is an interactive web-based tool designed to revolutionize the GenAI idea intake process within Wells Fargo. This assistant addresses critical inefficiencies in the current manual review process by providing intelligent guidance, automated duplicate detection, and comprehensive idea assessment capabilities. Through a conversational interface that follows Wells Fargo's design standards, the system will help users generate higher-quality GenAI proposals while reducing duplicate submissions and accelerating the approval process.

The core problem this feature solves is the inconsistent quality of GenAI idea submissions and the human bottleneck in the review process, which leads to missed opportunities and inaccurate project estimates.

## 2. Goals

1. **Increase Idea Quality**: Achieve 80% of submissions containing complete business cases with quantifiable success metrics and technical feasibility assessments
2. **Reduce Duplicate Submissions**: Decrease duplicate idea submissions by 60% through semantic duplicate detection
3. **Accelerate Time-to-Review**: Reduce average review time from submission to initial assessment by 50%
4. **Improve Resource Estimation Accuracy**: Increase accuracy of project resource estimates to within 20% of actual requirements
5. **Boost GenAI Adoption**: Increase monthly GenAI idea submissions by 20% within 6 months of launch
6. **Enhance Success Rate**: Achieve 15% increase in ideas progressing from experiment to deployment phase

## 3. User Stories

1. **As a business analyst new to AI**, I want to receive guided assistance in defining my GenAI idea so that I can submit a complete and technically feasible proposal without needing deep AI expertise.

2. **As a project manager**, I want to check if similar ideas already exist in the system so that I can avoid duplicate efforts and potentially collaborate with existing teams.

3. **As a developer**, I want to understand the appropriate AI solution level (Simple GenAI, GenAI with Tools, Agentic AI, Multi-Agent System) for my idea so that I can accurately estimate required resources and timelines.

4. **As an innovation team member**, I want to quickly generate comprehensive idea documentation so that I can focus on solution design rather than administrative tasks.

5. **As a reviewer**, I want to receive well-structured, complete submissions with clear metrics so that I can make faster and more informed approval decisions.

6. **As a stakeholder**, I want to view analytics about submitted ideas so that I can understand trends and identify high-value opportunities.
