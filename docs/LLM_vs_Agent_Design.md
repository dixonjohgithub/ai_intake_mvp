## Current Architecture: LLM APIs

The system relies on **OpenAI GPT-5 APIs** called directly from the application code with specific, controlled prompts for each task:

### Core LLM Integrations

1. **Question Generation**
   - Direct API calls to GPT-5 to generate contextual questions
   - Based on user responses and conversation history
   - Controlled by application logic

2. **Duplicate Detection**
   - OpenAI embeddings API (text-embedding-3-large)
   - Semantic similarity using cosine distance
   - Threshold-based matching (85% high, 60-84% medium)

3. **Form Generation**
   - GPT-5 API to structure collected data
   - Formats into Wells Fargo intake form template
   - Deterministic field mapping

4. **Idea Classification**
   - GPT-5 categorizes ideas into AI solution levels
   - Returns structured classification with confidence scores
   - Used for resource estimation

## Why Not Agents?

The system **classifies** ideas into agent categories but does **not implement agents itself**. Key reasons:

### 1. Controlled, Predictable Flow

- The conversation follows a structured, step-by-step wizard interface
- Predetermined logic paths with dynamic content
- No autonomous decision-making about conversation direction
- User maintains control throughout the process

### 2. Specific, Bounded Tasks

Each LLM call has a single, well-defined purpose:
- Generate the next contextual question
- Check for semantic duplicates
- Classify the idea complexity
- Generate form content from collected data

### 3. No Autonomous Behavior

The system lacks agent characteristics:
- ❌ No independent decision-making
- ❌ No autonomous tool selection
- ❌ No multi-step plan execution
- ❌ No self-directed external system interaction
- ✅ All actions are explicitly programmed
- ✅ Human approval required for major decisions

### 4. Human in the Loop

- All major decisions require user input
- Users can review and edit before submission
- No automated actions without user consent
- Transparent process with visible progress

## Implementation Details

### Direct LLM API Approach (Conceptual)

```javascript
// Question Generation - Direct API Call
async function generateNextQuestion(context) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: "You are helping collect information for a GenAI idea. Generate a follow-up question based on the context provided."
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: JSON.stringify({
          previousAnswers: context.answers,
          currentStep: context.step,
          ideaCategory: context.category
        })
      }
    ],
    temperature: 0.7,
    max_tokens: 150
  });

  // Log decision for audit trail
  await logDecision({
    type: 'question_generation',
    input: context,
    output: response.choices[0].message.content,
    confidence: response.choices[0].finish_reason,
    tokens: response.usage
  });

  return response.choices[0].message.content;
}

// Duplicate Detection - Embedding Comparison
async function checkDuplicates(ideaDescription) {
  // Generate embedding for new idea
  const embedding = await openai.embeddings.create({
    model: "text-embedding-3-large",
    input: ideaDescription
  });

  // Compare with stored embeddings
  const similarities = await compareEmbeddings(
    embedding.data[0].embedding,
    storedEmbeddings
  );

  // Return matches above threshold
  return similarities.filter(s => s.score > 0.6);
}

// Idea Classification - Structured Output
async function classifyIdea(ideaDetails) {
  const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
    model: "gpt-5",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "system",
        content: `Classify this idea into one of four categories:
          1. Simple GenAI - Basic prompt-response
          2. GenAI with Tools - LLM with function calling
          3. Agentic AI - Single autonomous agent
          4. Multi-Agent System - Multiple cooperating agents`
      },
      {
        role: "user",
        content: JSON.stringify(ideaDetails)
      }
    ],
    response_format: { type: "json_object" }
  });

  return JSON.parse(response.choices[0].message.content);
}
```

### Decision Logging Architecture

Every LLM interaction is logged for debugging and audit:

```javascript
async function logDecision(decision) {
  const logEntry = {
    log_id: generateUUID(),
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    decision_type: decision.type,
    input_context: decision.input,
    llm_response: decision.output,
    confidence_score: decision.confidence,
    token_usage: decision.tokens,
    execution_time_ms: decision.executionTime,
    session_id: getCurrentSessionId(),
    user_feedback: null // Populated later if provided
  };

  await saveToDecisionLog(logEntry);
}
```

## Comparison Table

| Aspect | Our Approach (LLM APIs) | Agent-Based Approach |
|--------|-------------------------|---------------------|
| **Decision Making** | Predetermined flow with LLM for content | Agents autonomously decide actions |
| **Tool Usage** | Application explicitly calls each API | Agents select tools independently |
| **Planning** | Fixed conversation flow, dynamic questions | Agents create and execute plans |
| **State Management** | Application manages all state | Agents maintain own context |
| **Error Handling** | Explicit try-catch blocks | Agents adapt to errors |
| **Debugging** | Straightforward, predictable | Complex agent behavior to trace |
| **Cost Control** | Precise API call management | Variable based on agent reasoning |
| **User Control** | Complete user visibility | Agent actions may be opaque |
| **Compliance** | Easy audit trail | Harder to track agent decisions |
| **Performance** | Fast, direct calls | Slower due to deliberation |

### 6. Cost-Effective
- Pay only for specific API calls
- No extended reasoning chains
- Predictable pricing model

## The Classification Paradox

Interestingly, while our system uses simple LLM APIs, it helps users understand which **level of AI solution** their idea requires:

### Classification Categories

1. **Simple GenAI**
   - Basic prompt-response (like our intake assistant)
   - No tool usage or external integrations
   - Single-turn or simple multi-turn interactions

2. **GenAI with Tools**
   - LLM with function/tool calling
   - Can query databases, call APIs
   - Still follows predetermined logic

3. **Agentic AI**
   - Single autonomous agent
   - Makes independent decisions
   - Creates and executes plans

4. **Multi-Agent System**
   - Multiple cooperating agents
   - Complex orchestration
   - Emergent behavior possible

### Our Position

The AI Intake Assistant itself operates at the **"Simple GenAI"** level:
- Direct API calls for specific tasks
- No tool usage beyond API calls
- Controlled, predictable behavior

This simplicity allows us to help teams understand more complex architectures without implementing that complexity ourselves.

## Future Considerations

### Potential Agent Evolution

While the MVP uses direct APIs, future versions could incorporate agent-like features:

1. **Phase 2: Tool-Augmented LLM**
   - Add function calling for database queries
   - Allow LLM to search knowledge base
   - Still maintain control flow

2. **Phase 3: Semi-Autonomous Assistant**
   - Allow limited autonomous decisions
   - Agent can choose question paths
   - Human approval still required

3. **Phase 4: Full Agent System**
   - Autonomous idea development
   - Multi-agent collaboration detection
   - Self-improving through feedback

### Migration Path

The current architecture supports gradual evolution:
```
Direct APIs → Tool Calling → Guided Agents → Autonomous Agents
     (MVP)        (v2.0)         (v3.0)           (Future)
```

### Decision Criteria for Agent Adoption

Consider agents when:
- User interactions become too complex for predetermined flows
- Need for autonomous decision-making is clear
- Cost of agent reasoning is justified by value
- Audit requirements can still be met
- User trust in autonomous systems increases

## Conclusion

The AI-Powered GenAI Idea Assistant deliberately uses a **straightforward LLM API architecture** rather than agents because:

1. **Requirements align with structured interactions** - The PRD specifies step-by-step guided collection
2. **Predictability is crucial** - Wells Fargo needs reliable, auditable behavior
3. **MVP philosophy** - Start simple, evolve based on user feedback
4. **Cost optimization** - Direct APIs are more economical for defined tasks
5. **Maintainability** - Easier for teams to understand and modify

This approach delivers intelligent assistance through GPT-5's capabilities while maintaining the control, transparency, and reliability required for an enterprise MVP.
