Use Case:

The interactive AI-powered assistant will help users generate more well-thought-out GenAI ideas and increase the number of ideas that progress to production by leveraging a knowledge base of GenAI best practices and by providing an interactive interface for idea exploration and experimentation.

1. Problem Statement:  
   The current AI intake process for GenAI ideas suffers from several inefficiencies:

* Inconsistent Idea Quality: Ideas lack clear business cases, quantifiable success metrics, and technical feasibility assessments.

* Human Bottleneck: Manual review of ideas is not scalable and creates delays in the approval process.

* Lack of Guidance: Submitters, especially those new to AI, struggle to define the appropriate AI solution level (Simple GenAI, GenAI with Tools, Agentic AI, Multi-Agent System) and accurately estimate project requirements.

* Missed Opportunities: Potentially valuable ideas may be overlooked due to incomplete information or a lack of clarity in the initial submission.

* Inaccurate Estimates: Developers new to AI may not be able to accurately estimate project estimates and timeframes.

* Difficulty in Measuring Improvement: Without defined solution baselines, it is challenging to quantitatively measure the effectiveness of new solutions and experimental changes.

* Duplicate Ideas: Similar ideas are often submitted independently, leading to wasted effort and resources. Identifying exact and fuzzy duplicates is relatively straightforward, but semantic duplicates (ideas that address the same underlying problem using different terminology or approaches) are difficult to detect manually.

2. Proposed Solution:  
   Develop an AI-powered assistant that guides users through the idea generation process.

   This AI-powered assistant will provide readily accessible knowledge and guidance on GenAI best practices and internal guidelines, directly within the idea generation workflow.

    It will leverage a knowledge base built from:

* The LLM’s inherent understanding of industry best practices for GenAI.

* Optional Internal documentation outlining the company’s specific best practices for using GenAI.

* This knowledge base will be continuously updated based on industry trends and internal learnings, ensuring the assistant provides the most relevant and up-to-date information.

* The assistant will feature a basic, interactive user interface allowing users to:  
  * Pose questions related to GenAI idea generation.  
  * Receive guidance on best practices for specific use cases.  
  * Access relevant internal documentation.  
  * Explore potential solutions based on proven strategies.

  The solution will Identify Duplicate Ideas:

* Exact Duplicates: Identify ideas with identical titles, descriptions, and objectives.

* Fuzzy Duplicates: Identify ideas with similar titles, descriptions, and objectives using techniques like fuzzy matching and cosine similarity.

* Semantic Duplicates: Employ advanced natural language processing (NLP) and semantic understanding to identify ideas that address the same underlying business problem, even if they use different terminology or propose different approaches.

This assistant will perform:

* Interactive Idea Elicitation: Engage users in a conversational manner to gather comprehensive information about their GenAI idea, adapting questions based on the user’s input and drawing from both the AI intake and newer AI-First frameworks.

* Automated Feasibility Assessment: Analyze the collected information to assess the technical feasibility of the idea, identify potential risks and dependencies, and suggest the appropriate level of AI solution (Simple GenAI, GenAI with Tools, Agentic AI, Multi-Agent System).

* Business Case Development: Help users define clear business objectives, quantifiable success metrics, and alignment with strategic priorities.

* Automated Form Generation: Generate a comprehensive form (AI intake or AI-First compatible) pre-populated with the gathered information, ready for submission.

* Knowledge Base Integration: Provide access to a knowledge base of successful GenAI projects, best practices, and relevant resources.

3. The project's goal is to:

* Increase Idea Quality: Higher quality submissions with clear business cases, quantifiable success metrics, and technical feasibility assessments.

* Reduce Duplication: Fewer redundant ideas submitted, saving time and resources.

* Faster Approval Process: Streamlined review process due to more complete and well-defined submissions.

* Improved Resource Allocation: More accurate estimates of required resources, leading to better project planning and execution.

* Increase GenAI Adoption: Easier for business teams to identify and submit promising GenAI ideas.

* Produce More Accurate AI Projects: Reduced risk of over- or under-engineering solutions.

* Increase deployments of usable solutions: Increased number of ideas progressing from the experiment phase to the deployment phase. (Quantify: e.g., a 15% increase in successful deployments)

* Generate ideas Faster: Reduced time spent searching for relevant information on GenAI best practices. (Quantify: e.g., a 50% reduction in search time); More GenAI ideas generated within the AI intake process. (Quantify: e.g., a 20% increase in ideas generated per month)

* Increased adherence to AI best practices: Increased adoption of GenAI best practices within the organization. (Quantify: e.g., track the number of users actively using the assistant)

4. How the Solution Will Work:  
* User Input: The user initiates the process by providing a brief description of their GenAI idea.

* AI-Powered Conversation: The AI assistant engages the user in a dynamic conversation, asking clarifying questions based on the initial input. These questions will cover areas such as:

   ○ Business Case & Objectives Questions:

  * What business outcome am I trying to achieve? (Start with this overarching goal)

  * Determining the right level of AI solution for your business problem and expected ROI

  * Identifying the required business systems and data sources the solution must be accessible.

  * Defining clear business success metrics that justify the investment.

  * Do I need to access business data or systems?

  * How many different systems need to be accessed?

  * Does this require multi-step reasoning or adaptation?

  * Do I need multiple specialized capabilities working together?

  * What’s your existing technology stack?

  * Do you have in-house AI expertise or need managed services?

* Feature Definition Questions:  
* Problem/Goal: “What problem does this feature solve for the user?” or “What is the main goal we want to achieve with this feature?”

* Target User: “Who is the primary user of this feature?”

* Core Functionality: “Can you describe the key actions a user should be able to perform with this feature?”

* User Stories: “Could you provide a few user stories? (e.g., As a \[type of user\], I want to \[perform an action\] so that \[benefit\].)”

* Acceptance Criteria: “How will we know when this feature is successfully implemented? What are the key success criteria?”

* Scope/Boundaries: “Are there any specific things this feature should not do (non-goals)?”

* Data Requirements: “What kind of data does this feature need to display or manipulate?”

* Design/UI: “Are there any existing design mockups or UI guidelines to follow?” or “Can you describe the desired look and feel?”

* Edge Cases: “Are there any potential edge cases or error conditions we should consider?”  
* During this intake process they will check the inventory for duplicate ideas with a confidence score. If an duplicate exists it will show the project and the contact person and deliver that to the user as a potential teaming parner.  
* Determine the appropriate level of AI solution (Simple GenAI, GenAI with Tools, Agentic AI, Multi-Agent System) based on the characteristics outlined in the problem description.  
*  The AI assistant generates:

  ○ A comprehensive form (AI intake or AI-First compatible) pre-populated with the gathered information.

  ○ A summary of the AI assistant’s analysis, including the recommended AI solution level, potential risks, and required resources.

  ○ A set of clear business success metrics.

* User Review and Submission:

   The user reviews the generated output and submits it through the appropriate channel (AI intake web form or AI-First presentation).
