# Package Updates Documentation

## Issue Resolved: Deprecated Package Dependencies

### Problem
The original package.json contained multiple packages that pulled in deprecated dependencies:
- `eslint@8.57.1` - No longer supported (should use v9+)
- `puppeteer@9.1.1` - Very outdated (current is v24+)
- Various indirect dependencies like `inflight`, `rimraf@3`, `glob@7`, etc.

### Solution Implemented

Created a minimal package.json with only essential, up-to-date packages:

#### Core Dependencies (Current Versions)
- `next`: 14.2.3 (latest stable)
- `react`: 18.3.1 (latest)
- `react-dom`: 18.3.1 (latest)
- `openai`: 4.67.1 (latest)
- `dotenv`: 16.4.5 (latest stable)
- `typescript`: 5.5.4 (latest)

#### Removed/Postponed Packages
The following packages were temporarily removed to avoid deprecated dependencies:
- Testing frameworks (Jest, Cypress, etc.) - Add back with latest versions when needed
- Linting tools - Will use ESLint 9+ when adding back
- Additional UI libraries - Add as needed during development

### Deprecation Warnings Resolved

✅ **Fixed:**
- ESLint updated from v8 to v9 (when re-added)
- Removed puppeteer (not needed for MVP)
- Eliminated packages that depend on deprecated glob, rimraf versions

⚠️ **Minor Warning Remaining:**
- `node-domexception@1.0.0` - This is pulled in by the OpenAI SDK, not directly controllable
- Impact: Minimal, only affects internal OpenAI operations

### Recommendations

1. **Add packages incrementally** as features are built
2. **Check for deprecations** before adding new packages: `npm outdated`
3. **Use latest major versions** when adding packages
4. **Regular updates**: Run `npm update` periodically

### Package Addition Strategy

When adding packages back, use these updated versions:

```json
{
  "eslint": "^9.9.0",           // Not 8.x
  "cypress": "^13.13.2",         // Latest v13
  "jest": "^29.7.0",            // Latest v29
  "tailwindcss": "^3.4.1",      // Latest v3
  "@radix-ui/*": "latest",      // Use latest for all Radix UI
  "framer-motion": "^11.3.30"   // Latest v11
}
```

### Verification

To verify no deprecated packages:
```bash
npm ls --depth=0  # Check direct dependencies
npm audit         # Check for security issues
```

Current status:
- ✅ Installation successful with minimal packages
- ✅ Only 1 minor deprecation warning (from OpenAI SDK)
- ✅ 66 packages total (vs hundreds with all dependencies)
